### Hi there, I'm Rohan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at the University of California, Berkeley . My interests primarily lie in systems and ML. In my free time I enjoy following bay area sports, hooping, bouldering, surfing, and listening to hip-hop and house music. Currently looking for new grad software engineering roles or internships starting in fall 2024. 

In the past, I've worked on:
- Distributed Systems and Automated RAG Model Evaluations @ [Redacted]
- Security @ [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com)
- Fullstack web dev stuff @ various places

Feel free to email or message me on any linked socials if you would like to chat virtually or in the bay area.
